# EasyDietLog
API for diet log application

Application description:
The idea of this project is to develop an app for a diet log, there are lots of diet apps, but I have never found a simple and easy one to use. This project is the backend rest API of this app and it will be possible to log the food and quantity you eat, and the app will show the amount of calories you eat.

For the user the necessary information is Name and e-mail. In the software, it will be possible to include food, for each food that is added, the user has to include:
* Name of the food
* Food energy
* Food energy unit

And the API will allow access to create a user, update a user, delete a user and list all the users. For food, the same actions will be allowed.

For the Daily log, each user will have one daily log and he/she can log as many foods as wanted and the day he/she is logging it. It will be possible to get a list of food for the user.
